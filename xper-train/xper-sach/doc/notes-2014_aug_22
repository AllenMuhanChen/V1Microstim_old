TODO:

1. fix GA stimulus generation:
	X FIXED-- limit max and min global sizes (might need to do more than this?) 
	X-- morphs often lead to bad looping, make sure looping checks are in place
	?-- general morph balancing: allow for multiple morphs applied?? -- might still need tweaking
	X FIXED-- caught one bad morph error: endless looping on a 'remove limb'
	
2. GA analysis
	-- want visual representation of stimulus avg firing rates and stdevs
	-- rank stimuli according to FR
	
3. Bah_quick analysis
	X-- display FRs and stdevs of categorical stimuli
	
	
4. Expt notes
	-- finish notes gui to add exp't info to ExpLog
	-- in the meantime, enter manually???
